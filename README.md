# Multi-Target-Tracking
Real-time simulation of people tracking using K-Means clustering and Gaussian occupancy mapping. This Python project mimics how mobile robots perceive dynamic environments by clustering noisy LIDAR-like data, assigning consistent IDs to moving people, and generating probabilistic 2D occupancy maps.
